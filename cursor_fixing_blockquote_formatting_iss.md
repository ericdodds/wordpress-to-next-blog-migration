# Fixing blockquote formatting issues
_Exported on 6/23/2025 at 10:27:25 GMT+3 from Cursor (1.1.3)_

**User**

in another chat you wrote "The pattern I'm seeing is that during the migration, paragraphs that should be separate were incorrectly grouped into blockquotes, often because there was no line break between the end of a quote and the start of the next paragraph." 

---

**Cursor**

Yes, that's correct! During content migrations—especially from platforms like WordPress to Markdown or MDX—it's common for formatting issues to arise. One frequent issue is that blockquotes (which should only contain quoted text) end up including additional paragraphs that aren't part of the quote. This usually happens when:

- The original content didn't have a clear line break (an empty line) between the end of a blockquote and the start of a new paragraph.
- The migration script or tool interpreted the lack of a line break as a continuation of the blockquote, so it wrapped both the quote and the following paragraph(s) in the same blockquote.

**Example of the issue:**

Suppose the original content looked like this in HTML or WordPress:

```html
<blockquote>
  This is a quote.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.</p>
```

But if there was no clear separation, or the migration tool didn't recognize it, you might end up with this in Markdown:

```markdown
> This is a quote.
This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.
```

Which renders as:

> This is a quote.
This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.

**Correct Markdown should be:**

```markdown
> This is a quote.

This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.
```

**How to fix:**  
You need to ensure that after a blockquote ends, there is a blank line before the next paragraph. This signals to Markdown parsers that the blockquote has ended.

If you have a script or want to automate the fix, I can help you write a tool to detect and correct these cases in your `.mdx` files. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with that!

```html
<blockquote>
  This is a quote.
</blockquote>
<p>This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.</p>
```

```markdown
> This is a quote.
This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.
```

```markdown
> This is a quote.

This is a new paragraph, not part of the quote.
```

**User**

can you grep the blog posts to see where that issue occurs? you can see examples in a past chat

---

**Cursor**

Here are some examples from your blog posts where a paragraph immediately follows a blockquote without a blank line, which may indicate the issue of paragraphs being incorrectly grouped into blockquotes:

1. **encouraging-compliments-for-running-a-nice-business.mdx**
   ```
   > It's not the fastest way to make a buck. It takes time. But it is way more sustainable than screwing people over.
   Fred's words have proven true for The Iron Yard. Every time I see our teams interacting with our students, the level of empathy and deep care is astounding.
   ```

2. **myths-of-productivity-finding-the-right-tools.mdx**
   ```
   > My concern is that there's a big difference between buying new running shoes and actually hitting the road every morning.
   **Tools and productivity**
   ```
   and
   ```
   > Ultimately, the tools that we choose for *any* purpose will only be as useful as our ability to use them effectively and to understand what their improved quality means to the way we approach our work…For some people, that might be a pen and paper, for others it might be fancy software. Choosing the 'right system' can be overwhelming with all of the choices available, but worrying about the right choice isn't the point. The point is capturing what you need to get done, then, as quickly as possible, moving on and *actually doing those things*.
   Tools should provide utility and then get out of the way so that we can move our work forward.
   ```

3. **history-repeats-itself.mdx**
   ```
   > Or at least, that's what newspapers in 1864 would have had you believe. The charge isn't true. But this miscegenation hoax still "damn near sank Lincoln that year," says Heather Cox Richardson, history professor at Boston College. In February 1864, Lincoln was preparing for a tough re-election campaign amidst a bloody civil war when he and his Republican party were blindsided.
   ```

4. **progress-without-questions.mdx**
   ```
   > But don’t forget the next wave of social media if you want to reach younger crowds. Secondary social sites like Snapchat and Secrets have grown in popularity among younger people. Companies have to meet them there in the future.One more, just for emphasis. There's no question here of how ephemeral social media forums affect young people, simply a mandate that businesses be there.

These are just a few examples; there may be more throughout your posts. Would you like a full list, or would you like help with a script to automatically fix these issues across your `.mdx` files?

**Cursor**

I'll help you generate a list of local URLs for all blog posts in alphabetical order by slug. Let me first get all the blog post files and then format them as localhost URLs.


Now I'll generate the complete list of local URLs for all blog posts in alphabetical order by slug. Let me continue listing the directory to get all files:


Perfect! Here's the complete list of local URLs for all blog posts in alphabetical order by slug:
